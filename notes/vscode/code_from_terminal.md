Although there might be many ways to do this like editing the bashrc or zshrc file, but the below method is easy and works like a charm.

1. Open VSCode and press <span style="color: #55acee;background-color: #1E242C;font-size:18px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande'">`Command` + `Shift` + `P`</span>
2. Then type <span style="color: #55acee;background-color: #1E242C;font-size:18px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande'">`Shell`</span> in command palette
3. You will see <span style="color: #55acee;background-color: #1E242C;font-size:18px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande'">`Shell Command: Install Code in Path`</span> 
   Click that and you are done!

> You can now open your terminal and type `code .`

> To open a particular directory in VSCode, go to that directory in terminal and type `code .` or alternatively `code [path of the folder]`
