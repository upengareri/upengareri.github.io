If you are a Mac user and want to open the present working folder or directory in a new Finder window from the terminal then use the below command:

	open .

Similarly, in order to open any application (e.g Chrome) within Mac, use:

	open -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/

`-a : specific application `

Let's say you frequently use chrome from terminal. In that case you can further hack to create a short version or symbolic link of the command to type less and save time. 

An example of a similar use case is described in my article -<br/> [how to open any file in sublime from terminal](./open_sublime_file_terminal.md)
