I am a data science enthusiast who loves writing code in Python. I have a love for finding pattern in data and in fact in so many other things around me (like behaviour). Weird right! I have 3+ years of experience in iOS app development which I still love doing.  

#### Education
* MS in Automotive Software Engineering from Technische Universit√§t Chemnitz, Germany
* B.Tech in Computer Science from ICFAI University, India

#### Likes
* Reading - books and blogs on self help, tech-stuff etc.
* Playing Table Tennis - once I was good at it; now just to cherish my old days and to enjoy (of course)
* Walking - yes, randomly walking here and there
* Travelling - especially to hill stations; love trekking as well
* Writing - not seriously but I enjoy it
* iPhoneograhpy - basically clicking photos on mobile (picture motivates me to write)
