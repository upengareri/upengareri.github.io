### 1. Directory or file can have 3 types of users

```
    u = User (owner)
    g = Group (members to which the file belongs)
    o = Others (rest of the world)

    a = All of the above
```

### 2. Directory or file can have 3 types of permissions

```
    r = Read
    w = Write
    x = Execute

      = (blank) None, no permissions
```

### 3. Users can be assigned various permissions using 3 types of operations

```
    + Add permission (permission is added to existing permissions)
    - Remove permission
    = Re-assign (set permission and remove other permissions)
```

The above 3 points are enough for us to understand what chmod is doing. Let's dive into some examples to decrypt chmod's actions -

<span style="color: #55acee;background-color: #1E242C;font-size:14px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande'">
chmod u=r file1.txt</span>   // User can read only

<span style="color: #55acee;background-color: #1E242C;font-size:14px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande'">
chmod g=rw file1.txt</span>   // Group can read and write
